1. Table Creation Queries
We'll need separate tables for each country (e.g., Table_India, Table_USA). These tables will have columns derived from your intermediate table layout. Additionally, columns like age and days_since_last_consult will be derived from existing data (DOB and Last Consulted Date).

Sample Table Creation Query (for India):


CREATE TABLE Table_India (
    Customer_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Customer_ID Int NOT NULL,
    Open_Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Last_Consulted_Date DATE,
    Vaccination_Type CHAR(5),
    Doctor_Consulted VARCHAR(255),
    State CHAR(5),
    Country CHAR(5),
    Post_Code INT,
    DOB DATE,
    Is_Active CHAR(1),
    Age INT AS (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(DOB)),
    Days_Since_Last_Consult INT AS (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), Last_Consulted_Date)),
    PRIMARY KEY (Customer_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE Table_USA (
    Customer_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Customer_ID Int NOT NULL,
    Open_Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Last_Consulted_Date DATE,
    Vaccination_Type CHAR(5),
    Doctor_Consulted VARCHAR(255),
    State CHAR(5),
    Country CHAR(5),
    Post_Code INT,
    DOB DATE,
    Is_Active CHAR(1),
    Age INT AS (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(DOB)),
    Days_Since_Last_Consult INT AS (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), Last_Consulted_Date)),
    PRIMARY KEY (Customer_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE Table_PHIL (
    Customer_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Customer_ID Int NOT NULL,
    Open_Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Last_Consulted_Date DATE,
    Vaccination_Type CHAR(5),
    Doctor_Consulted VARCHAR(255),
    State CHAR(5),
    Country CHAR(5),
    Post_Code INT,
    DOB DATE,
    Is_Active CHAR(1),
    Age INT AS (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(DOB)),
    Days_Since_Last_Consult INT AS (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), Last_Consulted_Date)),
    PRIMARY KEY (Customer_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE Table_NYC (
    Customer_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Customer_ID Int NOT NULL,
    Open_Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Last_Consulted_Date DATE,
    Vaccination_Type CHAR(5),
    Doctor_Consulted VARCHAR(255),
    State CHAR(5),
    Country CHAR(5),
    Post_Code INT,
    DOB DATE,
    Is_Active CHAR(1),
    Age INT AS (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(DOB)),
    Days_Since_Last_Consult INT AS (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), Last_Consulted_Date)),
    PRIMARY KEY (Customer_ID)
);



CREATE TABLE Table_AU (
    Customer_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Customer_ID Int NOT NULL,
    Open_Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Last_Consulted_Date DATE,
    Vaccination_Type CHAR(5),
    Doctor_Consulted VARCHAR(255),
    State CHAR(5),
    Country CHAR(5),
    Post_Code INT,
    DOB DATE,
    Is_Active CHAR(1),
    Age INT AS (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(DOB)),
    Days_Since_Last_Consult INT AS (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), Last_Consulted_Date)),
    PRIMARY KEY (Customer_ID)
);

INSERT INTO Table_USA (Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
                         Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active)
SELECT Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
       Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active
FROM Staging_Table st
WHERE Country = 'USA'



Inserting the PHIL country records in the below table

INSERT INTO Table_PHIL (Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
                         Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active)
SELECT Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
       Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active
FROM Staging_Table st
WHERE Country = 'PHIL'

Inserting the NYC country records in the below table

INSERT INTO Table_NYC (Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
                         Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active)
SELECT Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
       Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active
FROM Staging_Table st
WHERE Country = 'NYC'

Inserting the AU country records in the below table

INSERT INTO Table_AU (Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
                         Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active)
SELECT Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
       Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active
FROM Staging_Table st
WHERE Country = 'AU'
This query creates a table for India, where Age and Days_Since_Last_Consult are calculated automatically as derived columns.

2. Derived Columns (age and days since last consulted)

Age is calculated based on the year difference between the current date and the customer's DOB.
Age INT AS (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(DOB)),
Days_Since_Last_Consult INT AS (DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), Last_Consulted_Date))


3. Validation

Validate the customer name sholud not include a special character

select customer_name
from staging
where Customer_Name NOT LIKE ('%[^a-zA-Z ]%')

Ensure Customer_ID is unique for each entry.

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*)
FROM customer_table
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

Validate Open_Date and DOB are in proper date format.

SELECT *
FROM Staging_Table
WHERE (STR_TO_DATE(Open_Date, '%YYYYMMDD') IS NULL;

Validation to check if there are records where Days_Since_Last_Consult > 30


SELECT * FROM Table_India 
WHERE Days_Since_Last_Consult > 30;



If the customer is shifted to another country and visits from that country then consider the record with the latest consultant date.

INSERT INTO Table_India (Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
                         Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active)
SELECT Customer_Name, Customer_ID, Open_Date, Last_Consulted_Date, Vaccination_Type, 
       Doctor_Consulted, State, Country, Post_Code, DOB, Is_Active
FROM Staging_Table st
WHERE Country = 'IND'
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE 
    Last_Consulted_Date = (
        SELECT GREATEST(ti.Last_Consulted_Date, MAX(st.Last_Consulted_Date)) 
        FROM Table_India ti
        WHERE ti.Customer_ID = st.Customer_ID
    );
